## Appendix C: Trust Score Calculation

### Provider Trust Score Formula

```
ProviderTrustScore = (0.4 * HistoricalAccuracy) + (0.2 * VerificationLevel) + 
                    (0.15 * IssueResolution) + (0.15 * Transparency) + 
                    (0.1 * Longevity)
```

Where:
- HistoricalAccuracy: Weighted average of past verification scores
- VerificationLevel: Average certification level across provider's datasets
- IssueResolution: Score based on issue resolution speed and effectiveness
- Transparency: Score based on documentation, metadata quality, and disclosure
- Longevity: Score based on provider's history and stability

### Dataset Trust Score Formula

```
DatasetTrustScore = (0.35 * VerificationScore) + (0.25 * IssueDensity) + 
                   (0.2 * ConsistencyScore) + (0.2 * UserSatisfaction)
```

Where:
- VerificationScore: Score derived from verification test results
- IssueDensity: Score based on number and severity of issues relative to dataset size
- ConsistencyScore: Score measuring quality consistency across the dataset
- UserSatisfaction: Score derived from user feedback and usage metrics

### Contextual Trust Formula

```
ContextualTrustScore = BaseTrustScore * (UseAppropriatenessMultiplier) * 
                       (DomainSpecificQualityMultiplier)
```

Where:
- BaseTrustScore: Combined provider and dataset trust score
- UseAppropriatenessMultiplier: Factor based on fitness for specific use case
- DomainSpecificQualityMultiplier: Factor based on industry-specific quality indicators
